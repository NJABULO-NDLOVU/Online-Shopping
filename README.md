# Online-Shopping
This project involves predicting something that is somewhat of a “holy grail” of business intelligence: trying to predict whether or not a customer will eventually make a purchase while using an online shopping portal, based on the pattern of pages they have visited on the website, certain analytical features, the time of week and year, and other features. The data file you’ve been given is a selection of a much larger data set: it consists of 3816 data examples and 17 features; the output variable is the last              v     (18th) column of the file labelled “Revenue” and represents whether or not a customer eventually made a purchase (0 – purchase made  / 1 – purchase not made). This was a group project in which I was responsible for Neural Networks.
